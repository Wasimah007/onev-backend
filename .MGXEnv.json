The DDL contains the full database schema; use it to produce SQL creation scripts and backend code that talks to MySQL using raw SQL (no ORM). Include authentication, OpenAPI-ready endpoints, and follow backend best practices.\n\nHigh-level requirements\t\n\nDo not use any ORM (no SQLAlchemy ORM, Django ORM, or similar). Use an async database driver or a thin DB library for raw SQL (examples: databases with aiomysql / asyncmy, or aiomysql directly). All DB access must be raw SQL prepared statements (parameterized queries) to avoid SQL injection.\n\nAuthentication: Implement secure JWT-based authentication (access token + refresh token). Passwords must be hashed (bcrypt via passlib). Provide endpoints:\n\nPOST /auth/register \u2014 create user (validate input, hash pw)\n\nPOST /auth/login \u2014 obtain access + refresh tokens\n\nPOST /auth/refresh \u2014 exchange refresh token for new access token\n\nPOST /auth/logout \u2014 revoke refresh token (or blacklist)\nProtect business endpoints with OAuth2 password bearer (JWT). Use token lifetime config via environment variables.\n\nDB scripts: Convert the attached DDL Script.txt into:\n\nA ready-to-run MySQL DDL script file (schema.sql) that creates all tables/indexes/constraints in the correct order.\n\nA simple migrate.sh (or Docker-friendly step) that runs mysql -u$MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD $MYSQL_DATABASE < schema.sql.\n\nAPI design & implementation\n\nGenerate endpoints for all main resource entities from the DDL (CRUD where appropriate). Use RESTful paths and standard HTTP codes.\n\nUse Pydantic models for request/response schemas.\n\nInclude validation for inputs, use pagination for list endpoints, and filters where sensible.\n\nOpenAPI / docs\n\nEnsure FastAPI auto-generated OpenAPI is complete and exposes security schemes. Add good summary, description, and tags for endpoints.\n\nAdd example request/response schemas for key endpoints.\n\nProject layout & best practices\n\nProvide a clear folder structure (example below).\n\nUse environment variables for secrets/config (via pydantic.BaseSettings or python-decouple).\n\nProvide a database connection pool (single module) using async lifecycle events in FastAPI (startup/shutdown).\n\nUse dependency injection for DB and current user retrieval.\n\nUse structured logging and include example log config.\n\nKeep business logic separated from route handlers (services layer).\n\nAdd basic error handling middleware and HTTPException usage.\n\nSecurity\n\nInput validation, parameterized queries.\n\nProper JWT signing (secret from env), reasonable expiry (env-configurable).\n\nPassword hashing with bcrypt.\n\nRate-limit suggestions (note: you can mention slowapi or reverse-proxy rate limiting).\n\nDev & deployment\n\nInclude requirements.txt with pinned versions (FastAPI, uvicorn, databases/aiomysql or aiomysql, passlib, python-jose, pydantic, mysqlclient if needed).\n\nProvide docker-compose.yml for a local MySQL and the FastAPI service, plus instructions to run.\n\nProvide Makefile or scripts for common tasks: start, migrate, create-superuser.\n\nTests (minimum)\n\nProvide at least a couple of pytest examples showing how to test endpoints (authentication + one CRUD), using httpx.AsyncClient and a test database or fixtures.\n\nDeliverables (explicit)\n\nschema.sql generated from attached DDL.\n\nProject folder with files described below.\n\nREADME with setup, env vars, how to run migrations, how to run tests, and how to use the OpenAPI UI.\n\nSuggested folder layout (exact):\n\nbackend/\n\u251c\u2500 app/\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 main.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 config.py                # pydantic settings\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 db.py                    # connection pool and helpers (raw SQL)\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 auth/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 router.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 service.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 jwt.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 routers/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 users.py\n\u2502  \u2502 \u2514\u2500 <other resources>.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 services/                # business logic using raw SQL via db.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas/                 # pydantic models for resources\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 utils/                   # helpers (passwords, tokens, logging)\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 tests/\n\u251c\u2500 schema.sql\n\u251c\u2500 migrate.sh\n\u251c\u2500 requirements.txt\n\u251c\u2500 docker-compose.yml\n\u2514\u2500 README.md\n\n\nImportant constraints & implementation notes.\n\nUse the attached DDL Script.txt as the canonical source of truth for table/column names and relationships. If the DDL contains constraints or FK references, ensure the schema.sql orders CREATE TABLE statements to satisfy FK dependencies.\n\nAll SQL in code must be parameterized (no string interpolation for user inputs).\n\nUse async DB access patterns (async endpoints, async db driver).\n\nDo not stub out DB queries \u2014 implement real SQL for CRUD that maps to the DDL columns.\n\nInclude at least one example raw SQL query using joins that would be commonly needed (e.g., get timesheet rows for a user with project name).\n\nMake token verification reusable (dependency) and include example of role-based protection (e.g., admin-only endpoint).\n\nUse clear docstrings and small inline comments explaining key decisions.\n\nKeep code idiomatic and production-aware (timeouts, connection pooling, structured settings).\n\nIf something in DDL Script.txt is ambiguous (e.g., missing a users table or missing column type), make a reasonable assumption and explicitly document the assumption in the README and in the top of schema.sql.\n\nOutput format:\n\nProduce the full project tree and the contents of each file.\n\nAlso produce schema.sql and migrate.sh.\n\nInclude a short README and example curl commands for auth + one resource.\n\nEnd of prompt.",

The DDL contains the full database schema; use it to produce SQL creation scripts and backend code that talks to MySQL using raw SQL (no ORM). Include authentication, OpenAPI-ready endpoints, and follow backend best practices.\n\nHigh-level requirements\t\n\nDo not use any ORM (no SQLAlchemy ORM, Django ORM, or similar). Use an async database driver or a thin DB library for raw SQL (examples: databases with aiomysql / asyncmy, or aiomysql directly). All DB access must be raw SQL prepared statements (parameterized queries) to avoid SQL injection.\n\nAuthentication: Implement secure JWT-based authentication (access token + refresh token). Passwords must be hashed (bcrypt via passlib). Provide endpoints:\n\nPOST /auth/register \u2014 create user (validate input, hash pw)\n\nPOST /auth/login \u2014 obtain access + refresh tokens\n\nPOST /auth/refresh \u2014 exchange refresh token for new access token\n\nPOST /auth/logout \u2014 revoke refresh token (or blacklist)\nProtect business endpoints with OAuth2 password bearer (JWT). Use token lifetime config via environment variables.\n\nDB scripts: Convert the attached DDL Script.txt into:\n\nA ready-to-run MySQL DDL script file (schema.sql) that creates all tables/indexes/constraints in the correct order.\n\nA simple migrate.sh (or Docker-friendly step) that runs mysql -u$MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD $MYSQL_DATABASE < schema.sql.\n\nAPI design & implementation\n\nGenerate endpoints for all main resource entities from the DDL (CRUD where appropriate). Use RESTful paths and standard HTTP codes.\n\nUse Pydantic models for request/response schemas.\n\nInclude validation for inputs, use pagination for list endpoints, and filters where sensible.\n\nOpenAPI / docs\n\nEnsure FastAPI auto-generated OpenAPI is complete and exposes security schemes. Add good summary, description, and tags for endpoints.\n\nAdd example request/response schemas for key endpoints.\n\nProject layout & best practices\n\nProvide a clear folder structure (example below).\n\nUse environment variables for secrets/config (via pydantic.BaseSettings or python-decouple).\n\nProvide a database connection pool (single module) using async lifecycle events in FastAPI (startup/shutdown).\n\nUse dependency injection for DB and current user retrieval.\n\nUse structured logging and include example log config.\n\nKeep business logic separated from route handlers (services layer).\n\nAdd basic error handling middleware and HTTPException usage.\n\nSecurity\n\nInput validation, parameterized queries.\n\nProper JWT signing (secret from env), reasonable expiry (env-configurable).\n\nPassword hashing with bcrypt.\n\nRate-limit suggestions (note: you can mention slowapi or reverse-proxy rate limiting).\n\nDev & deployment\n\nInclude requirements.txt with pinned versions (FastAPI, uvicorn, databases/aiomysql or aiomysql, passlib, python-jose, pydantic, mysqlclient if needed).\n\nProvide docker-compose.yml for a local MySQL and the FastAPI service, plus instructions to run.\n\nProvide Makefile or scripts for common tasks: start, migrate, create-superuser.\n\nTests (minimum)\n\nProvide at least a couple of pytest examples showing how to test endpoints (authentication + one CRUD), using httpx.AsyncClient and a test database or fixtures.\n\nDeliverables (explicit)\n\nschema.sql generated from attached DDL.\n\nProject folder with files described below.\n\nREADME with setup, env vars, how to run migrations, how to run tests, and how to use the OpenAPI UI.\n\nSuggested folder layout (exact):\n\nbackend/\n\u251c\u2500 app/\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 main.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 config.py                # pydantic settings\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 db.py                    # connection pool and helpers (raw SQL)\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 auth/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 router.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 service.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 jwt.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 routers/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 users.py\n\u2502  \u2502 \u2514\u2500 <other resources>.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 services/                # business logic using raw SQL via db.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas/                 # pydantic models for resources\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 utils/                   # helpers (passwords, tokens, logging)\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 tests/\n\u251c\u2500 schema.sql\n\u251c\u2500 migrate.sh\n\u251c\u2500 requirements.txt\n\u251c\u2500 docker-compose.yml\n\u2514\u2500 README.md\n\n\nImportant constraints & implementation notes.\n\nUse the attached DDL Script.txt as the canonical source of truth for table/column names and relationships. If the DDL contains constraints or FK references, ensure the schema.sql orders CREATE TABLE statements to satisfy FK dependencies.\n\nAll SQL in code must be parameterized (no string interpolation for user inputs).\n\nUse async DB access patterns (async endpoints, async db driver).\n\nDo not stub out DB queries \u2014 implement real SQL for CRUD that maps to the DDL columns.\n\nInclude at least one example raw SQL query using joins that would be commonly needed (e.g., get timesheet rows for a user with project name).\n\nMake token verification reusable (dependency) and include example of role-based protection (e.g., admin-only endpoint).\n\nUse clear docstrings and small inline comments explaining key decisions.\n\nKeep code idiomatic and production-aware (timeouts, connection pooling, structured settings).\n\nIf something in DDL Script.txt is ambiguous (e.g., missing a users table or missing column type), make a reasonable assumption and explicitly document the assumption in the README and in the top of schema.sql.\n\nOutput format:\n\nProduce the full project tree and the contents of each file.\n\nAlso produce schema.sql and migrate.sh.\n\nInclude a short README and example curl commands for auth + one resource.\n\nEnd of prompt.",

The DDL contains the full database schema; use it to produce SQL creation scripts and backend code that talks to MySQL using raw SQL (no ORM). Include authentication, OpenAPI-ready endpoints, and follow backend best practices.\n\nHigh-level requirements\t\n\nDo not use any ORM (no SQLAlchemy ORM, Django ORM, or similar). Use an async database driver or a thin DB library for raw SQL (examples: databases with aiomysql / asyncmy, or aiomysql directly). All DB access must be raw SQL prepared statements (parameterized queries) to avoid SQL injection.\n\nAuthentication: Implement secure JWT-based authentication (access token + refresh token). Passwords must be hashed (bcrypt via passlib). Provide endpoints:\n\nPOST /auth/register \u2014 create user (validate input, hash pw)\n\nPOST /auth/login \u2014 obtain access + refresh tokens\n\nPOST /auth/refresh \u2014 exchange refresh token for new access token\n\nPOST /auth/logout \u2014 revoke refresh token (or blacklist)\nProtect business endpoints with OAuth2 password bearer (JWT). Use token lifetime config via environment variables.\n\nDB scripts: Convert the attached DDL Script.txt into:\n\nA ready-to-run MySQL DDL script file (schema.sql) that creates all tables/indexes/constraints in the correct order.\n\nA simple migrate.sh (or Docker-friendly step) that runs mysql -u$MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD $MYSQL_DATABASE < schema.sql.\n\nAPI design & implementation\n\nGenerate endpoints for all main resource entities from the DDL (CRUD where appropriate). Use RESTful paths and standard HTTP codes.\n\nUse Pydantic models for request/response schemas.\n\nInclude validation for inputs, use pagination for list endpoints, and filters where sensible.\n\nOpenAPI / docs\n\nEnsure FastAPI auto-generated OpenAPI is complete and exposes security schemes. Add good summary, description, and tags for endpoints.\n\nAdd example request/response schemas for key endpoints.\n\nProject layout & best practices\n\nProvide a clear folder structure (example below).\n\nUse environment variables for secrets/config (via pydantic.BaseSettings or python-decouple).\n\nProvide a database connection pool (single module) using async lifecycle events in FastAPI (startup/shutdown).\n\nUse dependency injection for DB and current user retrieval.\n\nUse structured logging and include example log config.\n\nKeep business logic separated from route handlers (services layer).\n\nAdd basic error handling middleware and HTTPException usage.\n\nSecurity\n\nInput validation, parameterized queries.\n\nProper JWT signing (secret from env), reasonable expiry (env-configurable).\n\nPassword hashing with bcrypt.\n\nRate-limit suggestions (note: you can mention slowapi or reverse-proxy rate limiting).\n\nDev & deployment\n\nInclude requirements.txt with pinned versions (FastAPI, uvicorn, databases/aiomysql or aiomysql, passlib, python-jose, pydantic, mysqlclient if needed).\n\nProvide docker-compose.yml for a local MySQL and the FastAPI service, plus instructions to run.\n\nProvide Makefile or scripts for common tasks: start, migrate, create-superuser.\n\nTests (minimum)\n\nProvide at least a couple of pytest examples showing how to test endpoints (authentication + one CRUD), using httpx.AsyncClient and a test database or fixtures.\n\nDeliverables (explicit)\n\nschema.sql generated from attached DDL.\n\nProject folder with files described below.\n\nREADME with setup, env vars, how to run migrations, how to run tests, and how to use the OpenAPI UI.\n\nSuggested folder layout (exact):\n\nbackend/\n\u251c\u2500 app/\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 main.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 config.py                # pydantic settings\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 db.py                    # connection pool and helpers (raw SQL)\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 auth/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 router.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 service.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 jwt.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 routers/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 users.py\n\u2502  \u2502 \u2514\u2500 <other resources>.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 services/                # business logic using raw SQL via db.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas/                 # pydantic models for resources\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 utils/                   # helpers (passwords, tokens, logging)\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 tests/\n\u251c\u2500 schema.sql\n\u251c\u2500 migrate.sh\n\u251c\u2500 requirements.txt\n\u251c\u2500 docker-compose.yml\n\u2514\u2500 README.md\n\n\nImportant constraints & implementation notes.\n\nUse the attached DDL Script.txt as the canonical source of truth for table/column names and relationships. If the DDL contains constraints or FK references, ensure the schema.sql orders CREATE TABLE statements to satisfy FK dependencies.\n\nAll SQL in code must be parameterized (no string interpolation for user inputs).\n\nUse async DB access patterns (async endpoints, async db driver).\n\nDo not stub out DB queries \u2014 implement real SQL for CRUD that maps to the DDL columns.\n\nInclude at least one example raw SQL query using joins that would be commonly needed (e.g., get timesheet rows for a user with project name).\n\nMake token verification reusable (dependency) and include example of role-based protection (e.g., admin-only endpoint).\n\nUse clear docstrings and small inline comments explaining key decisions.\n\nKeep code idiomatic and production-aware (timeouts, connection pooling, structured settings).\n\nIf something in DDL Script.txt is ambiguous (e.g., missing a users table or missing column type), make a reasonable assumption and explicitly document the assumption in the README and in the top of schema.sql.\n\nOutput format:\n\nProduce the full project tree and the contents of each file.\n\nAlso produce schema.sql and migrate.sh.\n\nInclude a short README and example curl commands for auth + one resource.\n\nEnd of prompt.",

The DDL contains the full database schema; use it to produce SQL creation scripts and backend code that talks to MySQL using raw SQL (no ORM). Include authentication, OpenAPI-ready endpoints, and follow backend best practices.\n\nHigh-level requirements\t\n\nDo not use any ORM (no SQLAlchemy ORM, Django ORM, or similar). Use an async database driver or a thin DB library for raw SQL (examples: databases with aiomysql / asyncmy, or aiomysql directly). All DB access must be raw SQL prepared statements (parameterized queries) to avoid SQL injection.\n\nAuthentication: Implement secure JWT-based authentication (access token + refresh token). Passwords must be hashed (bcrypt via passlib). Provide endpoints:\n\nPOST /auth/register \u2014 create user (validate input, hash pw)\n\nPOST /auth/login \u2014 obtain access + refresh tokens\n\nPOST /auth/refresh \u2014 exchange refresh token for new access token\n\nPOST /auth/logout \u2014 revoke refresh token (or blacklist)\nProtect business endpoints with OAuth2 password bearer (JWT). Use token lifetime config via environment variables.\n\nDB scripts: Convert the attached DDL Script.txt into:\n\nA ready-to-run MySQL DDL script file (schema.sql) that creates all tables/indexes/constraints in the correct order.\n\nA simple migrate.sh (or Docker-friendly step) that runs mysql -u$MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD $MYSQL_DATABASE < schema.sql.\n\nAPI design & implementation\n\nGenerate endpoints for all main resource entities from the DDL (CRUD where appropriate). Use RESTful paths and standard HTTP codes.\n\nUse Pydantic models for request/response schemas.\n\nInclude validation for inputs, use pagination for list endpoints, and filters where sensible.\n\nOpenAPI / docs\n\nEnsure FastAPI auto-generated OpenAPI is complete and exposes security schemes. Add good summary, description, and tags for endpoints.\n\nAdd example request/response schemas for key endpoints.\n\nProject layout & best practices\n\nProvide a clear folder structure (example below).\n\nUse environment variables for secrets/config (via pydantic.BaseSettings or python-decouple).\n\nProvide a database connection pool (single module) using async lifecycle events in FastAPI (startup/shutdown).\n\nUse dependency injection for DB and current user retrieval.\n\nUse structured logging and include example log config.\n\nKeep business logic separated from route handlers (services layer).\n\nAdd basic error handling middleware and HTTPException usage.\n\nSecurity\n\nInput validation, parameterized queries.\n\nProper JWT signing (secret from env), reasonable expiry (env-configurable).\n\nPassword hashing with bcrypt.\n\nRate-limit suggestions (note: you can mention slowapi or reverse-proxy rate limiting).\n\nDev & deployment\n\nInclude requirements.txt with pinned versions (FastAPI, uvicorn, databases/aiomysql or aiomysql, passlib, python-jose, pydantic, mysqlclient if needed).\n\nProvide docker-compose.yml for a local MySQL and the FastAPI service, plus instructions to run.\n\nProvide Makefile or scripts for common tasks: start, migrate, create-superuser.\n\nTests (minimum)\n\nProvide at least a couple of pytest examples showing how to test endpoints (authentication + one CRUD), using httpx.AsyncClient and a test database or fixtures.\n\nDeliverables (explicit)\n\nschema.sql generated from attached DDL.\n\nProject folder with files described below.\n\nREADME with setup, env vars, how to run migrations, how to run tests, and how to use the OpenAPI UI.\n\nSuggested folder layout (exact):\n\nbackend/\n\u251c\u2500 app/\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 main.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 config.py                # pydantic settings\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 db.py                    # connection pool and helpers (raw SQL)\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 auth/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 router.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 service.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 jwt.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 routers/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 users.py\n\u2502  \u2502 \u2514\u2500 <other resources>.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 services/                # business logic using raw SQL via db.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas/                 # pydantic models for resources\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 utils/                   # helpers (passwords, tokens, logging)\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 tests/\n\u251c\u2500 schema.sql\n\u251c\u2500 migrate.sh\n\u251c\u2500 requirements.txt\n\u251c\u2500 docker-compose.yml\n\u2514\u2500 README.md\n\n\nImportant constraints & implementation notes.\n\nUse the attached DDL Script.txt as the canonical source of truth for table/column names and relationships. If the DDL contains constraints or FK references, ensure the schema.sql orders CREATE TABLE statements to satisfy FK dependencies.\n\nAll SQL in code must be parameterized (no string interpolation for user inputs).\n\nUse async DB access patterns (async endpoints, async db driver).\n\nDo not stub out DB queries \u2014 implement real SQL for CRUD that maps to the DDL columns.\n\nInclude at least one example raw SQL query using joins that would be commonly needed (e.g., get timesheet rows for a user with project name).\n\nMake token verification reusable (dependency) and include example of role-based protection (e.g., admin-only endpoint).\n\nUse clear docstrings and small inline comments explaining key decisions.\n\nKeep code idiomatic and production-aware (timeouts, connection pooling, structured settings).\n\nIf something in DDL Script.txt is ambiguous (e.g., missing a users table or missing column type), make a reasonable assumption and explicitly document the assumption in the README and in the top of schema.sql.\n\nOutput format:\n\nProduce the full project tree and the contents of each file.\n\nAlso produce schema.sql and migrate.sh.\n\nInclude a short README and example curl commands for auth + one resource.\n\nEnd of prompt.",

The DDL contains the full database schema; use it to produce SQL creation scripts and backend code that talks to MySQL using raw SQL (no ORM). Include authentication, OpenAPI-ready endpoints, and follow backend best practices.\n\nHigh-level requirements\t\n\nDo not use any ORM (no SQLAlchemy ORM, Django ORM, or similar). Use an async database driver or a thin DB library for raw SQL (examples: databases with aiomysql / asyncmy, or aiomysql directly). All DB access must be raw SQL prepared statements (parameterized queries) to avoid SQL injection.\n\nAuthentication: Implement secure JWT-based authentication (access token + refresh token). Passwords must be hashed (bcrypt via passlib). Provide endpoints:\n\nPOST /auth/register \u2014 create user (validate input, hash pw)\n\nPOST /auth/login \u2014 obtain access + refresh tokens\n\nPOST /auth/refresh \u2014 exchange refresh token for new access token\n\nPOST /auth/logout \u2014 revoke refresh token (or blacklist)\nProtect business endpoints with OAuth2 password bearer (JWT). Use token lifetime config via environment variables.\n\nDB scripts: Convert the attached DDL Script.txt into:\n\nA ready-to-run MySQL DDL script file (schema.sql) that creates all tables/indexes/constraints in the correct order.\n\nA simple migrate.sh (or Docker-friendly step) that runs mysql -u$MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD $MYSQL_DATABASE < schema.sql.\n\nAPI design & implementation\n\nGenerate endpoints for all main resource entities from the DDL (CRUD where appropriate). Use RESTful paths and standard HTTP codes.\n\nUse Pydantic models for request/response schemas.\n\nInclude validation for inputs, use pagination for list endpoints, and filters where sensible.\n\nOpenAPI / docs\n\nEnsure FastAPI auto-generated OpenAPI is complete and exposes security schemes. Add good summary, description, and tags for endpoints.\n\nAdd example request/response schemas for key endpoints.\n\nProject layout & best practices\n\nProvide a clear folder structure (example below).\n\nUse environment variables for secrets/config (via pydantic.BaseSettings or python-decouple).\n\nProvide a database connection pool (single module) using async lifecycle events in FastAPI (startup/shutdown).\n\nUse dependency injection for DB and current user retrieval.\n\nUse structured logging and include example log config.\n\nKeep business logic separated from route handlers (services layer).\n\nAdd basic error handling middleware and HTTPException usage.\n\nSecurity\n\nInput validation, parameterized queries.\n\nProper JWT signing (secret from env), reasonable expiry (env-configurable).\n\nPassword hashing with bcrypt.\n\nRate-limit suggestions (note: you can mention slowapi or reverse-proxy rate limiting).\n\nDev & deployment\n\nInclude requirements.txt with pinned versions (FastAPI, uvicorn, databases/aiomysql or aiomysql, passlib, python-jose, pydantic, mysqlclient if needed).\n\nProvide docker-compose.yml for a local MySQL and the FastAPI service, plus instructions to run.\n\nProvide Makefile or scripts for common tasks: start, migrate, create-superuser.\n\nTests (minimum)\n\nProvide at least a couple of pytest examples showing how to test endpoints (authentication + one CRUD), using httpx.AsyncClient and a test database or fixtures.\n\nDeliverables (explicit)\n\nschema.sql generated from attached DDL.\n\nProject folder with files described below.\n\nREADME with setup, env vars, how to run migrations, how to run tests, and how to use the OpenAPI UI.\n\nSuggested folder layout (exact):\n\nbackend/\n\u251c\u2500 app/\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 main.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 config.py                # pydantic settings\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 db.py                    # connection pool and helpers (raw SQL)\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 auth/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 router.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 service.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 jwt.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 routers/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 users.py\n\u2502  \u2502 \u2514\u2500 <other resources>.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 services/                # business logic using raw SQL via db.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas/                 # pydantic models for resources\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 utils/                   # helpers (passwords, tokens, logging)\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 tests/\n\u251c\u2500 schema.sql\n\u251c\u2500 migrate.sh\n\u251c\u2500 requirements.txt\n\u251c\u2500 docker-compose.yml\n\u2514\u2500 README.md\n\n\nImportant constraints & implementation notes.\n\nUse the attached DDL Script.txt as the canonical source of truth for table/column names and relationships. If the DDL contains constraints or FK references, ensure the schema.sql orders CREATE TABLE statements to satisfy FK dependencies.\n\nAll SQL in code must be parameterized (no string interpolation for user inputs).\n\nUse async DB access patterns (async endpoints, async db driver).\n\nDo not stub out DB queries \u2014 implement real SQL for CRUD that maps to the DDL columns.\n\nInclude at least one example raw SQL query using joins that would be commonly needed (e.g., get timesheet rows for a user with project name).\n\nMake token verification reusable (dependency) and include example of role-based protection (e.g., admin-only endpoint).\n\nUse clear docstrings and small inline comments explaining key decisions.\n\nKeep code idiomatic and production-aware (timeouts, connection pooling, structured settings).\n\nIf something in DDL Script.txt is ambiguous (e.g., missing a users table or missing column type), make a reasonable assumption and explicitly document the assumption in the README and in the top of schema.sql.\n\nOutput format:\n\nProduce the full project tree and the contents of each file.\n\nAlso produce schema.sql and migrate.sh.\n\nInclude a short README and example curl commands for auth + one resource.\n\nEnd of prompt.",

ORM) with MySQL, JWT authentication, and comprehensive API endpoints.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Raw SQL Implementation**: No ORM dependencies, using `databases` with `aiomysql` for async MySQL operations\n- **JWT Authentication**: Secure access/refresh token system with bcrypt password hashing\n- **Comprehensive API**: Full CRUD operations for users, projects, departments, and timesheet management\n- **Production Ready**: Structured logging, rate limiting, error handling, and Docker support\n- **OpenAPI Documentation**: Auto-generated API docs with security schemes\n- **Testing**: Pytest examples with async support\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nbackend/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 app/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py                 # FastAPI application entry point\n\u2502

Environment Setup\n\nCreate a `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`):\n\n```bash\ncp .env.example .env\n```\n\nEdit the `.env` file with your configuration:\n\n```env\n# Database\nMYSQL_HOST=localhost\nMYSQL_PORT=3306\nMYSQL_USER=root\nMYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password\nMYSQL_DATABASE=fastapi_backend\n\n# JWT (CHANGE IN PRODUCTION!)\nJWT_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production\n\n# Application\nDEBUG=true\n```\n\n### 2. Using Docker (Recommended)\n\nStart all services:\n\n```bash\nmake docker-up\n```\n\nThis will start:\n- MySQL database on port 3306\n- FastAPI application on port 8000\n\n### 3. Manual Setup\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nStart MySQL and run migrations:\n\n```bash\nmake migrate\n```\n\nStart the development server:\n\n```bash\nmake dev\n```\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe application includes a comprehensive database schema with:\n\n- **users**: User accounts with authentication\n- **departments**: Organizational departments\n- **projects**: Project management\n- **project_assignments**: User-project relationships\n- **timesheet_entries**: Time tracking entries\n- **refresh_tokens**: JWT refresh token management\n\n### Default Admin User\n\nAfter running migrations, a default admin user is created:\n\n- **Email**: admin@example.com\n- **Username**: admin\n- **Password**: admin123\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f Change this password immediately in production!**\n\n## API Endpoints\n\n### Authentication\n\n- `POST /api/v1/auth/register` - Register new user\n- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - Login (get tokens)\n- `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` - Refresh access token\n- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` - Logout (revoke refresh token)\n- `GET /api/v1/auth/me` - Get current user profile\n- `POST /api/v1/auth/change-password` - Change password\n\n### Users\n\n- `GET /api/v1/users/` - List users (with pagination/filtering)\n- `POST /api/v1/users/` - Create user (admin only)\n- `GET /api/v1/users/{id}` - Get user by ID\n- `PUT /api/v1/users/{id}` - Update user\n- `DELETE /api/v1/users/{id}` - Delete user (admin only)\n\n### Timesheet\n\n- `GET /api/v1/timesheet/entries` - List timesheet entries\n- `POST /api/v1/timesheet/entries` - Create timesheet entry\n- `GET /api/v1/timesheet/entries/{id}` - Get entry by ID\n- `PUT /api/v1/timesheet/entries/{id}` - Update entry\n- `DELETE /api/v1/timesheet/entries/{id}` - Delete entry\n- `POST /api/v1/timesheet/entries/submit` - Submit entries for approval\n- `POST /api/v1/timesheet/entries/approve` - Approve/reject entries (admin)\n\n## API Documentation\n\nOnce the server is running, visit:\n\n- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8000/docs\n- **ReDoc**: http://localhost:8000/redoc\n- **OpenAPI JSON**: http://localhost:8000/openapi.json\n\n## Example Usage\n\n### 1. Register a User\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"email\": \"user@example.com\",\n    \"username\": \"testuser\",\n    \"password\": \"password123\",\n    \"first_name\": \"Test\",\n    \"last_name\": \"User\"\n  }'\n```\n\n### 2. Login\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\\n  -d \"username=testuser&password=password123\"\n```\n\n### 3. Access Protected Endpoint\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/me\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\n```\n\n### 4. Create Timesheet Entry\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/timesheet/entries\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"project_id\": 1,\n    \"work_date\": \"2024-01-15\",\n    \"hours_worked\": 8.0,\n    \"description\": \"Development work\"\n  }'\n```\n\n## Development\n\n### Running Tests\n\n```bash\nmake test\n```\n\n### Code Formatting\n\n```bash\nmake format\n```\n\n### Linting\n\n```bash\nmake lint\n```\n\n### Database Operations\n\n```bash\n# Run migrations\nmake migrate\n\n# Backup database\nmake backup-db\n\n# Restore database\nmake restore-db BACKUP_FILE=backup_20240115_120000.sql\n```\n\n## Security Features\n\n- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with configurable rounds\n- **JWT Tokens**: Signed with secret key, configurable expiration\n- **Parameterized Queries**: All SQL uses parameterized queries to prevent injection\n- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting with slowapi\n- **Input Validation**: Pydantic models for request/response validation\n- **CORS**: Configurable CORS settings\n- **Refresh Token Management**: Secure refresh token storage and revocation\n\n## Environment Variables\n\n| Variable | Description | Default |\n|----------|-------------|---------|\n| `MYSQL_HOST` | MySQL host | localhost |\n| `MYSQL_PORT` | MySQL port | 3306 |\n| `MYSQL_USER` | MySQL username | root |\n| `MYSQL_PASSWORD` | MySQL password | password |\n| `MYSQL_DATABASE` | Database name | fastapi_backend |\n| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | JWT signing key | (change in production!) |\n| `JWT_ALGORITHM` | JWT algorithm | HS256 |\n| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | Access token lifetime | 30 |\n| `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS` | Refresh token lifetime | 7 |\n| `DEBUG` | Debug mode | false |\n| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Allowed CORS origins | [\"*\"] |\n\n## Production Deployment\n\n1. **Change Security Settings**:\n   - Generate a strong `JWT_SECRET_KEY`\n   - Set `DEBUG=false",

The DDL contains the full database schema; use it to produce SQL creation scripts and backend code that talks to MySQL using raw SQL (no ORM). Include authentication, OpenAPI-ready endpoints, and follow backend best practices.\n\nHigh-level requirements\t\n\nDo not use any ORM (no SQLAlchemy ORM, Django ORM, or similar). Use an async database driver or a thin DB library for raw SQL (examples: databases with aiomysql / asyncmy, or aiomysql directly). All DB access must be raw SQL prepared statements (parameterized queries) to avoid SQL injection.\n\nAuthentication: Implement secure JWT-based authentication (access token + refresh token). Passwords must be hashed (bcrypt via passlib). Provide endpoints:\n\nPOST /auth/register \u2014 create user (validate input, hash pw)\n\nPOST /auth/login \u2014 obtain access + refresh tokens\n\nPOST /auth/refresh \u2014 exchange refresh token for new access token\n\nPOST /auth/logout \u2014 revoke refresh token (or blacklist)\nProtect business endpoints with OAuth2 password bearer (JWT). Use token lifetime config via environment variables.\n\nDB scripts: Convert the attached DDL Script.txt into:\n\nA ready-to-run MySQL DDL script file (schema.sql) that creates all tables/indexes/constraints in the correct order.\n\nA simple migrate.sh (or Docker-friendly step) that runs mysql -u$MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD $MYSQL_DATABASE < schema.sql.\n\nAPI design & implementation\n\nGenerate endpoints for all main resource entities from the DDL (CRUD where appropriate). Use RESTful paths and standard HTTP codes.\n\nUse Pydantic models for request/response schemas.\n\nInclude validation for inputs, use pagination for list endpoints, and filters where sensible.\n\nOpenAPI / docs\n\nEnsure FastAPI auto-generated OpenAPI is complete and exposes security schemes. Add good summary, description, and tags for endpoints.\n\nAdd example request/response schemas for key endpoints.\n\nProject layout & best practices\n\nProvide a clear folder structure (example below).\n\nUse environment variables for secrets/config (via pydantic.BaseSettings or python-decouple).\n\nProvide a database connection pool (single module) using async lifecycle events in FastAPI (startup/shutdown).\n\nUse dependency injection for DB and current user retrieval.\n\nUse structured logging and include example log config.\n\nKeep business logic separated from route handlers (services layer).\n\nAdd basic error handling middleware and HTTPException usage.\n\nSecurity\n\nInput validation, parameterized queries.\n\nProper JWT signing (secret from env), reasonable expiry (env-configurable).\n\nPassword hashing with bcrypt.\n\nRate-limit suggestions (note: you can mention slowapi or reverse-proxy rate limiting).\n\nDev & deployment\n\nInclude requirements.txt with pinned versions (FastAPI, uvicorn, databases/aiomysql or aiomysql, passlib, python-jose, pydantic, mysqlclient if needed).\n\nProvide docker-compose.yml for a local MySQL and the FastAPI service, plus instructions to run.\n\nProvide Makefile or scripts for common tasks: start, migrate, create-superuser.\n\nTests (minimum)\n\nProvide at least a couple of pytest examples showing how to test endpoints (authentication + one CRUD), using httpx.AsyncClient and a test database or fixtures.\n\nDeliverables (explicit)\n\nschema.sql generated from attached DDL.\n\nProject folder with files described below.\n\nREADME with setup, env vars, how to run migrations, how to run tests, and how to use the OpenAPI UI.\n\nSuggested folder layout (exact):\n\nbackend/\n\u251c\u2500 app/\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 main.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 config.py                # pydantic settings\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 db.py                    # connection pool and helpers (raw SQL)\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 auth/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 router.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 service.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 jwt.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 routers/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 users.py\n\u2502  \u2502 \u2514\u2500 <other resources>.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 services/                # business logic using raw SQL via db.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas/                 # pydantic models for resources\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 utils/                   # helpers (passwords, tokens, logging)\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 tests/\n\u251c\u2500 schema.sql\n\u251c\u2500 migrate.sh\n\u251c\u2500 requirements.txt\n\u251c\u2500 docker-compose.yml\n\u2514\u2500 README.md\n\n\nImportant constraints & implementation notes.\n\nUse the attached DDL Script.txt as the canonical source of truth for table/column names and relationships. If the DDL contains constraints or FK references, ensure the schema.sql orders CREATE TABLE statements to satisfy FK dependencies.\n\nAll SQL in code must be parameterized (no string interpolation for user inputs).\n\nUse async DB access patterns (async endpoints, async db driver).\n\nDo not stub out DB queries \u2014 implement real SQL for CRUD that maps to the DDL columns.\n\nInclude at least one example raw SQL query using joins that would be commonly needed (e.g., get timesheet rows for a user with project name).\n\nMake token verification reusable (dependency) and include example of role-based protection (e.g., admin-only endpoint).\n\nUse clear docstrings and small inline comments explaining key decisions.\n\nKeep code idiomatic and production-aware (timeouts, connection pooling, structured settings).\n\nIf something in DDL Script.txt is ambiguous (e.g., missing a users table or missing column type), make a reasonable assumption and explicitly document the assumption in the README and in the top of schema.sql.\n\nOutput format:\n\nProduce the full project tree and the contents of each file.\n\nAlso produce schema.sql and migrate.sh.\n\nInclude a short README and example curl commands for auth + one resource.\n\nEnd of prompt.",

Environment Setup\n\nCreate a `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`):\n\n```bash\ncp .env.example .env\n```\n\nEdit the `.env` file with your configuration:\n\n```env\n# Database\nMYSQL_HOST=localhost\nMYSQL_PORT=3306\nMYSQL_USER=root\nMYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password\nMYSQL_DATABASE=fastapi_backend\n\n# JWT (CHANGE IN PRODUCTION!)\nJWT_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production\n\n# Application\nDEBUG=true\n```\n\n### 2. Using Docker (Recommended)\n\nStart all services:\n\n```bash\nmake docker-up\n```\n\nThis will start:\n- MySQL database on port 3306\n- FastAPI application on port 8000\n\n### 3. Manual Setup\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nStart MySQL and run migrations:\n\n```bash\nmake migrate\n```\n\nStart the development server:\n\n```bash\nmake dev\n```\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe application includes a comprehensive database schema with:\n\n- **users**: User accounts with authentication\n- **departments**: Organizational departments\n- **projects**: Project management\n- **project_assignments**: User-project relationships\n- **timesheet_entries**: Time tracking entries\n- **refresh_tokens**: JWT refresh token management\n\n### Default Admin User\n\nAfter running migrations, a default admin user is created:\n\n- **Email**: admin@example.com\n- **Username**: admin\n- **Password**: admin123\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f Change this password immediately in production!**\n\n## API Endpoints\n\n### Authentication\n\n- `POST /api/v1/auth/register` - Register new user\n- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - Login (get tokens)\n- `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` - Refresh access token\n- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` - Logout (revoke refresh token)\n- `GET /api/v1/auth/me` - Get current user profile\n- `POST /api/v1/auth/change-password` - Change password\n\n### Users\n\n- `GET /api/v1/users/` - List users (with pagination/filtering)\n- `POST /api/v1/users/` - Create user (admin only)\n- `GET /api/v1/users/{id}` - Get user by ID\n- `PUT /api/v1/users/{id}` - Update user\n- `DELETE /api/v1/users/{id}` - Delete user (admin only)\n\n### Timesheet\n\n- `GET /api/v1/timesheet/entries` - List timesheet entries\n- `POST /api/v1/timesheet/entries` - Create timesheet entry\n- `GET /api/v1/timesheet/entries/{id}` - Get entry by ID\n- `PUT /api/v1/timesheet/entries/{id}` - Update entry\n- `DELETE /api/v1/timesheet/entries/{id}` - Delete entry\n- `POST /api/v1/timesheet/entries/submit` - Submit entries for approval\n- `POST /api/v1/timesheet/entries/approve` - Approve/reject entries (admin)\n\n## API Documentation\n\nOnce the server is running, visit:\n\n- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8000/docs\n- **ReDoc**: http://localhost:8000/redoc\n- **OpenAPI JSON**: http://localhost:8000/openapi.json\n\n## Example Usage\n\n### 1. Register a User\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"email\": \"user@example.com\",\n    \"username\": \"testuser\",\n    \"password\": \"password123\",\n    \"first_name\": \"Test\",\n    \"last_name\": \"User\"\n  }'\n```\n\n### 2. Login\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\\n  -d \"username=testuser&password=password123\"\n```\n\n### 3. Access Protected Endpoint\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/me\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\n```\n\n### 4. Create Timesheet Entry\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/timesheet/entries\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"project_id\": 1,\n    \"work_date\": \"2024-01-15\",\n    \"hours_worked\": 8.0,\n    \"description\": \"Development work\"\n  }'\n```\n\n## Development\n\n### Running Tests\n\n```bash\nmake test\n```\n\n### Code Formatting\n\n```bash\nmake format\n```\n\n### Linting\n\n```bash\nmake lint\n```\n\n### Database Operations\n\n```bash\n# Run migrations\nmake migrate\n\n# Backup database\nmake backup-db\n\n# Restore database\nmake restore-db BACKUP_FILE=backup_20240115_120000.sql\n```\n\n## Security Features\n\n- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with configurable rounds\n- **JWT Tokens**: Signed with secret key, configurable expiration\n- **Parameterized Queries**: All SQL uses parameterized queries to prevent injection\n- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting with slowapi\n- **Input Validation**: Pydantic models for request/response validation\n- **CORS**: Configurable CORS settings\n- **Refresh Token Management**: Secure refresh token storage and revocation\n\n## Environment Variables\n\n| Variable | Description | Default |\n|----------|-------------|---------|\n| `MYSQL_HOST` | MySQL host | localhost |\n| `MYSQL_PORT` | MySQL port | 3306 |\n| `MYSQL_USER` | MySQL username | root |\n| `MYSQL_PASSWORD` | MySQL password | password |\n| `MYSQL_DATABASE` | Database name | fastapi_backend |\n| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | JWT signing key | (change in production!) |\n| `JWT_ALGORITHM` | JWT algorithm | HS256 |\n| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | Access token lifetime | 30 |\n| `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS` | Refresh token lifetime | 7 |\n| `DEBUG` | Debug mode | false |\n| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Allowed CORS origins | [\"*\"] |\n\n## Production Deployment\n\n1. **Change Security Settings**:\n   - Generate a strong `JWT_SECRET_KEY`\n   - Set `DEBUG=false",

The DDL contains the full database schema; use it to produce SQL creation scripts and backend code that talks to MySQL using raw SQL (no ORM). Include authentication, OpenAPI-ready endpoints, and follow backend best practices.\n\nHigh-level requirements\t\n\nDo not use any ORM (no SQLAlchemy ORM, Django ORM, or similar). Use an async database driver or a thin DB library for raw SQL (examples: databases with aiomysql / asyncmy, or aiomysql directly). All DB access must be raw SQL prepared statements (parameterized queries) to avoid SQL injection.\n\nAuthentication: Implement secure JWT-based authentication (access token + refresh token). Passwords must be hashed (bcrypt via passlib). Provide endpoints:\n\nPOST /auth/register \u2014 create user (validate input, hash pw)\n\nPOST /auth/login \u2014 obtain access + refresh tokens\n\nPOST /auth/refresh \u2014 exchange refresh token for new access token\n\nPOST /auth/logout \u2014 revoke refresh token (or blacklist)\nProtect business endpoints with OAuth2 password bearer (JWT). Use token lifetime config via environment variables.\n\nDB scripts: Convert the attached DDL Script.txt into:\n\nA ready-to-run MySQL DDL script file (schema.sql) that creates all tables/indexes/constraints in the correct order.\n\nA simple migrate.sh (or Docker-friendly step) that runs mysql -u$MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD $MYSQL_DATABASE < schema.sql.\n\nAPI design & implementation\n\nGenerate endpoints for all main resource entities from the DDL (CRUD where appropriate). Use RESTful paths and standard HTTP codes.\n\nUse Pydantic models for request/response schemas.\n\nInclude validation for inputs, use pagination for list endpoints, and filters where sensible.\n\nOpenAPI / docs\n\nEnsure FastAPI auto-generated OpenAPI is complete and exposes security schemes. Add good summary, description, and tags for endpoints.\n\nAdd example request/response schemas for key endpoints.\n\nProject layout & best practices\n\nProvide a clear folder structure (example below).\n\nUse environment variables for secrets/config (via pydantic.BaseSettings or python-decouple).\n\nProvide a database connection pool (single module) using async lifecycle events in FastAPI (startup/shutdown).\n\nUse dependency injection for DB and current user retrieval.\n\nUse structured logging and include example log config.\n\nKeep business logic separated from route handlers (services layer).\n\nAdd basic error handling middleware and HTTPException usage.\n\nSecurity\n\nInput validation, parameterized queries.\n\nProper JWT signing (secret from env), reasonable expiry (env-configurable).\n\nPassword hashing with bcrypt.\n\nRate-limit suggestions (note: you can mention slowapi or reverse-proxy rate limiting).\n\nDev & deployment\n\nInclude requirements.txt with pinned versions (FastAPI, uvicorn, databases/aiomysql or aiomysql, passlib, python-jose, pydantic, mysqlclient if needed).\n\nProvide docker-compose.yml for a local MySQL and the FastAPI service, plus instructions to run.\n\nProvide Makefile or scripts for common tasks: start, migrate, create-superuser.\n\nTests (minimum)\n\nProvide at least a couple of pytest examples showing how to test endpoints (authentication + one CRUD), using httpx.AsyncClient and a test database or fixtures.\n\nDeliverables (explicit)\n\nschema.sql generated from attached DDL.\n\nProject folder with files described below.\n\nREADME with setup, env vars, how to run migrations, how to run tests, and how to use the OpenAPI UI.\n\nSuggested folder layout (exact):\n\nbackend/\n\u251c\u2500 app/\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 main.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 config.py                # pydantic settings\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 db.py                    # connection pool and helpers (raw SQL)\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 auth/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 router.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 service.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 jwt.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 routers/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 users.py\n\u2502  \u2502 \u2514\u2500 <other resources>.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 services/                # business logic using raw SQL via db.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas/                 # pydantic models for resources\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 utils/                   # helpers (passwords, tokens, logging)\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 tests/\n\u251c\u2500 schema.sql\n\u251c\u2500 migrate.sh\n\u251c\u2500 requirements.txt\n\u251c\u2500 docker-compose.yml\n\u2514\u2500 README.md\n\n\nImportant constraints & implementation notes.\n\nUse the attached DDL Script.txt as the canonical source of truth for table/column names and relationships. If the DDL contains constraints or FK references, ensure the schema.sql orders CREATE TABLE statements to satisfy FK dependencies.\n\nAll SQL in code must be parameterized (no string interpolation for user inputs).\n\nUse async DB access patterns (async endpoints, async db driver).\n\nDo not stub out DB queries \u2014 implement real SQL for CRUD that maps to the DDL columns.\n\nInclude at least one example raw SQL query using joins that would be commonly needed (e.g., get timesheet rows for a user with project name).\n\nMake token verification reusable (dependency) and include example of role-based protection (e.g., admin-only endpoint).\n\nUse clear docstrings and small inline comments explaining key decisions.\n\nKeep code idiomatic and production-aware (timeouts, connection pooling, structured settings).\n\nIf something in DDL Script.txt is ambiguous (e.g., missing a users table or missing column type), make a reasonable assumption and explicitly document the assumption in the README and in the top of schema.sql.\n\nOutput format:\n\nProduce the full project tree and the contents of each file.\n\nAlso produce schema.sql and migrate.sh.\n\nInclude a short README and example curl commands for auth + one resource.\n\nEnd of prompt.",

            "instruction": "\nYou are a world-class engineer, your goal is to write google-style, elegant, modular, readable, maintainable, fully functional, and ready-for-production code.\nYou have been tasked with developing a web app or game.\nUnless the user or a system design specifies, or an existing repo is provided, you should use FrontendEngineer.search_template to search for a template. For website development, the default tech stack is the Shadcn-ui template with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. The template helps you get started, see the Template section for more information.\n0. Principles\n - ALWAYS develop an MVP version of the requirement by taking the easiest way and minimum steps to complete the requirement. Proritize successful completion over perfection.\n - When requirements are unclear enough, make reasonable assumptions based on common best practices and proceed with implementation. Only ask for clarification when missing information is critical to core functionality and cannot be reasonably inferred.\n - DON'T make improvements without user's consent. End current round of development IMMEDIATELY if you have completed all listed features.\n - If you encounter any issues related to the listed features, fix them directly. Your fix should take minimum steps. When you complete your fix, run `pmpn run lint` for a final check. If the check passes, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to ask the user to test on your fix outcome IMMEDIATELY. You should STOP fixing without user's feedback.\n - If you cannot solve the encountered issues with reasonable attempts, you should ask human immediately for help.\n1. Preparation\n - When provided a system design, read it first with Editor.read in a single response without any other commands. After reading, clearly indicate what files are instructed by the system design, then adhere to the design in your implementation. You may skip this step if no system design is provided.\n - For ANY development task (new project or incremental development) requiring user authentication or data storage, read the Backend section first (MANDATORY BEFORE ANY CODE IMPLEMENTATION OR MODIFICATION).\n - Start by acknowledging the user requirements with RoleZero.reply_to_human and use FrontendEngineer.search_template to search for a template for the project. Output only these two commands in one response first, start development only after you have the template.\n - Before coding, write down an MVP todo.md file listing all code files you need to create, their content, and how they are related to each other. The implementation should be as simple as possible to ensure higher success rate. If the complexity of the requirement is too high, select only the easiest and the most important part to implement, state explicitly your choice. There should be no more thann 8 code files, this is a HARD limit. Throughout the development, always pay attention to the **todo.md** file and adhere to it closely.\n - When the user provides their files, don't cd to the file folder to check the files, just directly copy them to the template public folder and use them.\n2. When creating new code files or rewriting code files, you should write multiple files. Use Editor.write multiple times based on your system design.\n3. Write out every code detail, DON'T leave TODO or PLACEHOLDER.\n6. After finishing the React/Vue/Shadcn-ui project, run `pnpm i && pnpm run lint && pnpm run build` to install dependencies and check for potential issues. Perform this operation every time you complete your development (i.e., for the first user requirment and every incremental requirement that follows). If you use any new dependencies in your code, make sure to use `pnpm add` to add them. If you encounter any errors, don't skip them, fix them before proceeding. Try your fix for up to 3 times, if it still fails, report the problem and suggest creating a new chat or remixing from a previous working version.\n7. Make sure you have checked the lint result and fixed all errors before running 'end' command. DON'T run 'pnpm run lint' and 'end' command at the same time.\n8. DON'T run or test non-React/Vue/Shadcn-ui projects (such as Python, Java, or Go) yourself. Users should be responsible for running these projects on their own. This step is CRUCIAL for the project to be set up correctly.\n9. Use correct file paths, mind any cd command, for the current directory will change after executing the cd command and applies to all commands after it.\n10. Regarding personal card development: if no additional user information has been provided, you should directly deploy the retrieved template without any modifications.\n11. Check project structure and read necessary files when provided with a repo that you have no information for.\n12. When the developed project needs to obtain images, do not fetch them in advance.\n14. For data dashboard requirements, use the streamlit template. To ensure the project runs correctly, when the user provides data, first view a small portion of the data, and then design the data dashboard based on the data and user requirements.\n15. For Streamlit projects, you must enable the debug option during deployment to ensure the project runs correctly. Use `streamlit run your_script.py` to run the project and don't assign a port.\n16. For projects requiring user-provided data:\n - If Data Analyst has provided JSON/other files, first use Editor.read to understand the key-value structure, then copy to the public directory with appropriate subfolders (e.g., `public/data/some_data.json`). Use relative path in the code. Never rewrite data files.\n - If no JSON is provided, read using Editor.read, then process the raw data using code, and format it in a way that's optimal for frontend display. DO NOT write data yourself.\n - If there are Markdown files, you should copy them to workspace directory and then use it directly. \n - If there are static files (images, audios, videos, 3D models) when using React/Vue/Shadcn-ui template, you MUST copy them to public/assets directory with appropriate subfolders and replace file path relative to public directory.\n17. Always update the web title in index.html when using React/Vue/Shadcn-ui template.\n18. Regarding previewing the project:\n - For projects from React/Vue/Shadcn-ui/Slidev/Remotion/html template, you don't need run dev or preview the project for it is already running and DO NOT modify the config file contents. Simply end after you pass the lint check.\n - For projects from streamlit template, use Previewer.preview_project to enable preview functionality.\n - Pay attention to the chat history. If the user has already previewed the project, don't preview it again.\n - Otherwise, use Terminal to launch a service if applicable. After you successfully launch a service, solidify the required commands with Previewer.preview_project. This tells the user use these commands to put the project into preview. Don't preview the project again if it has been previewed successfully.\n19. After completing any code development, use CheckUI.run to validate that the UI rendering matches the given instructions.\n - If the Render Grade > 1, end the development process.\n - If the Render Grade is 0 or 1, First, ask the user if fix is needed by `RoleZero.ask_human`: 1) It's working fine. 2) Ask @Alex to fix the issue. Then decide the next steps based on their feedback.\n - If the Render Grade doesn't improve after 2 attempts, suggest the user either start over or try remixing it with the message `We've already optimized this over 2 times. Keep going and we probably still won't get the results you want, but you'll burn through your credits. I'd suggest remix from a previous working version or start a new chat with the same requirement.`.\n - NEVER use <CheckUI.run> and <end></end> in the same response. Always wait for CheckUI results before using <end></end>. \n20. When using RoleZero.reply_to_human, avoid using overly absolute or definitive statements such as \u201ceverything is working perfectly,\u201d \u201cthe app is fully developed,\u201d or \u201cthe interface is fully functional and pass all tests.\u201d\n21. When finishing current request, give recommendation to users to whether: a. preview the application in the App Viewer, b. click the publish button to deploy, c. share the link, based on the task type. Encourage them to provide feedback and report any issues or unexpected behavior.\n22. Design principles for visual artifacts: When creating visual artifacts (HTML, React components, or any UI elements):\n- **For complex applications (Three.js, games, simulations)**: Prioritize functionality, performance, and user experience over visual flair. Focus on:\n  - Smooth frame rates and responsive controls\n  - Clear, intuitive user interfaces\n  - Efficient resource usage and optimized rendering\n  - Stable, bug-free interactions\n  - Simple, functional design that doesn't interfere with the core experience\n- **For landing pages, marketing sites, and presentational content**: Consider the emotional impact and \"wow factor\" of the design. Ask yourself: \"Would this make someone stop scrolling and say 'whoa'?\" Modern users expect visually engaging, interactive experiences that feel alive and dynamic.\n- Default to contemporary design trends and modern aesthetic choices unless specifically asked for something traditional. Consider what's cutting-edge in current web design (dark modes, glassmorphism, micro-animations, 3D elements, bold typography, vibrant gradients).\n- Static designs should be the exception, not the rule. Include thoughtful animations, hover effects, and interactive elements that make the interface feel responsive and alive. Even subtle movements can dramatically improve user engagement.\n- When faced with design decisions, lean toward the bold and unexpected rather than the safe and conventional. This includes:\n  - Color choices (vibrant vs muted)\n  - Layout decisions (dynamic vs traditional)\n  - Typography (expressive vs conservative)\n  - Visual effects (immersive vs minimal)\n- Push the boundaries of what's possible with the available technologies. Use advanced CSS features, complex animations, and creative JavaScript interactions. The goal is to create experiences that feel premium and cutting-edge.\n- Ensure accessibility with proper contrast and semantic markup\n- Create functional, working demonstrations rather than placeholders\n\n<Template>\nNo template available\n</Template>\n\n<Backend>\nSupabase is not enabled\n</Backend>\n",

The DDL contains the full database schema; use it to produce SQL creation scripts and backend code that talks to MySQL using raw SQL (no ORM). Include authentication, OpenAPI-ready endpoints, and follow backend best practices.\n\nHigh-level requirements\t\n\nDo not use any ORM (no SQLAlchemy ORM, Django ORM, or similar). Use an async database driver or a thin DB library for raw SQL (examples: databases with aiomysql / asyncmy, or aiomysql directly). All DB access must be raw SQL prepared statements (parameterized queries) to avoid SQL injection.\n\nAuthentication: Implement secure JWT-based authentication (access token + refresh token). Passwords must be hashed (bcrypt via passlib). Provide endpoints:\n\nPOST /auth/register \u2014 create user (validate input, hash pw)\n\nPOST /auth/login \u2014 obtain access + refresh tokens\n\nPOST /auth/refresh \u2014 exchange refresh token for new access token\n\nPOST /auth/logout \u2014 revoke refresh token (or blacklist)\nProtect business endpoints with OAuth2 password bearer (JWT). Use token lifetime config via environment variables.\n\nDB scripts: Convert the attached DDL Script.txt into:\n\nA ready-to-run MySQL DDL script file (schema.sql) that creates all tables/indexes/constraints in the correct order.\n\nA simple migrate.sh (or Docker-friendly step) that runs mysql -u$MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD $MYSQL_DATABASE < schema.sql.\n\nAPI design & implementation\n\nGenerate endpoints for all main resource entities from the DDL (CRUD where appropriate). Use RESTful paths and standard HTTP codes.\n\nUse Pydantic models for request/response schemas.\n\nInclude validation for inputs, use pagination for list endpoints, and filters where sensible.\n\nOpenAPI / docs\n\nEnsure FastAPI auto-generated OpenAPI is complete and exposes security schemes. Add good summary, description, and tags for endpoints.\n\nAdd example request/response schemas for key endpoints.\n\nProject layout & best practices\n\nProvide a clear folder structure (example below).\n\nUse environment variables for secrets/config (via pydantic.BaseSettings or python-decouple).\n\nProvide a database connection pool (single module) using async lifecycle events in FastAPI (startup/shutdown).\n\nUse dependency injection for DB and current user retrieval.\n\nUse structured logging and include example log config.\n\nKeep business logic separated from route handlers (services layer).\n\nAdd basic error handling middleware and HTTPException usage.\n\nSecurity\n\nInput validation, parameterized queries.\n\nProper JWT signing (secret from env), reasonable expiry (env-configurable).\n\nPassword hashing with bcrypt.\n\nRate-limit suggestions (note: you can mention slowapi or reverse-proxy rate limiting).\n\nDev & deployment\n\nInclude requirements.txt with pinned versions (FastAPI, uvicorn, databases/aiomysql or aiomysql, passlib, python-jose, pydantic, mysqlclient if needed).\n\nProvide docker-compose.yml for a local MySQL and the FastAPI service, plus instructions to run.\n\nProvide Makefile or scripts for common tasks: start, migrate, create-superuser.\n\nTests (minimum)\n\nProvide at least a couple of pytest examples showing how to test endpoints (authentication + one CRUD), using httpx.AsyncClient and a test database or fixtures.\n\nDeliverables (explicit)\n\nschema.sql generated from attached DDL.\n\nProject folder with files described below.\n\nREADME with setup, env vars, how to run migrations, how to run tests, and how to use the OpenAPI UI.\n\nSuggested folder layout (exact):\n\nbackend/\n\u251c\u2500 app/\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 main.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 config.py                # pydantic settings\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 db.py                    # connection pool and helpers (raw SQL)\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 auth/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 router.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 service.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 jwt.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 routers/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 users.py\n\u2502  \u2502 \u2514\u2500 <other resources>.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 services/                # business logic using raw SQL via db.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas/                 # pydantic models for resources\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 utils/                   # helpers (passwords, tokens, logging)\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 tests/\n\u251c\u2500 schema.sql\n\u251c\u2500 migrate.sh\n\u251c\u2500 requirements.txt\n\u251c\u2500 docker-compose.yml\n\u2514\u2500 README.md\n\n\nImportant constraints & implementation notes.\n\nUse the attached DDL Script.txt as the canonical source of truth for table/column names and relationships. If the DDL contains constraints or FK references, ensure the schema.sql orders CREATE TABLE statements to satisfy FK dependencies.\n\nAll SQL in code must be parameterized (no string interpolation for user inputs).\n\nUse async DB access patterns (async endpoints, async db driver).\n\nDo not stub out DB queries \u2014 implement real SQL for CRUD that maps to the DDL columns.\n\nInclude at least one example raw SQL query using joins that would be commonly needed (e.g., get timesheet rows for a user with project name).\n\nMake token verification reusable (dependency) and include example of role-based protection (e.g., admin-only endpoint).\n\nUse clear docstrings and small inline comments explaining key decisions.\n\nKeep code idiomatic and production-aware (timeouts, connection pooling, structured settings).\n\nIf something in DDL Script.txt is ambiguous (e.g., missing a users table or missing column type), make a reasonable assumption and explicitly document the assumption in the README and in the top of schema.sql.\n\nOutput format:\n\nProduce the full project tree and the contents of each file.\n\nAlso produce schema.sql and migrate.sh.\n\nInclude a short README and example curl commands for auth + one resource.\n\nEnd of prompt.",

The DDL contains the full database schema; use it to produce SQL creation scripts and backend code that talks to MySQL using raw SQL (no ORM). Include authentication, OpenAPI-ready endpoints, and follow backend best practices.\n\nHigh-level requirements\t\n\nDo not use any ORM (no SQLAlchemy ORM, Django ORM, or similar). Use an async database driver or a thin DB library for raw SQL (examples: databases with aiomysql / asyncmy, or aiomysql directly). All DB access must be raw SQL prepared statements (parameterized queries) to avoid SQL injection.\n\nAuthentication: Implement secure JWT-based authentication (access token + refresh token). Passwords must be hashed (bcrypt via passlib). Provide endpoints:\n\nPOST /auth/register \u2014 create user (validate input, hash pw)\n\nPOST /auth/login \u2014 obtain access + refresh tokens\n\nPOST /auth/refresh \u2014 exchange refresh token for new access token\n\nPOST /auth/logout \u2014 revoke refresh token (or blacklist)\nProtect business endpoints with OAuth2 password bearer (JWT). Use token lifetime config via environment variables.\n\nDB scripts: Convert the attached DDL Script.txt into:\n\nA ready-to-run MySQL DDL script file (schema.sql) that creates all tables/indexes/constraints in the correct order.\n\nA simple migrate.sh (or Docker-friendly step) that runs mysql -u$MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD $MYSQL_DATABASE < schema.sql.\n\nAPI design & implementation\n\nGenerate endpoints for all main resource entities from the DDL (CRUD where appropriate).

            "instruction": "\nBased on the context, write a plan or modify an existing plan to achieve the goal. A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don't forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\n\n6. Carefully consider how you handle web tasks:\n - Use SearchEnhancedQA for general information searching, i.e. querying search engines, such as googling news, weather, wiki, etc. Usually, no link is provided.\n - Use Browser for reading, navigating, or in-domain searching within a specific web, such as reading a blog, searching products from a given e-commerce web link, or interacting with a web app.\n - Use DataAnalyst.write_and_execute_code for web scraping, such as gathering batch data or info from a provided link.\n - Write code to view the HTML content rather than using the Browser tool.\n - Make sure the command_name are certainly in Available Commands when you use the Browser tool.\n7. When you are making plan. It is highly recommend to plan and append all the tasks in first response once time, except for 7.1.\n7.1. When the requirement is inquiring about a pdf, docx, md, or txt document, read the document first through either Editor.read WITHOUT a plan. After reading the document, use RoleZero.reply_to_human if the requirement can be answered straightaway, otherwise, make a plan if further calculation is needed.\n8. If the requirement explicitly mentions generating/creating/writing/producing a document/report/summary, you should use Editor.write to output the document.\n9. Don't finish_current_task multiple times for the same task.\n10. Finish current task timely, such as when the code is written and executed successfully.\n11. When using the command 'end', add the command 'finish_current_task' before it.\n12. When asked to convert user provided data for web display, convert them to JSON format based on user requirement, and store them ALL and totally. DO NOT use ellipsis (...) or only part of the data.\n13. If you have trouble processing docx or pdf documents, try use some tools (like python-docx, PyPDF2 etc.). Never generate data by yourself. For Word documents, carefully preserve all formatting elements including structure, styling, and embedded content, sophisticated design is needed.\n",

Use RESTful paths and standard HTTP codes.\n\nUse Pydantic models for request/response schemas.\n\nInclude validation for inputs, use pagination for list endpoints, and filters where sensible.\n\nOpenAPI / docs\n\nEnsure FastAPI auto-generated OpenAPI is complete and exposes security schemes. Add good summary, description, and tags for endpoints.\n\nAdd example request/response schemas for key endpoints.\n\nProject layout & best practices\n\nProvide a clear folder structure (example below).\n\nUse environment variables for secrets/config (via pydantic.BaseSettings or python-decouple).\n\nProvide a database connection pool (single module) using async lifecycle events in FastAPI (startup/shutdown).\n\nUse dependency injection for DB and current user retrieval.\n\nUse structured logging and include example log config.\n\nKeep business logic separated from route handlers (services layer).\n\nAdd basic error handling middleware and HTTPException usage.\n\nSecurity\n\nInput validation, parameterized queries.\n\nProper JWT signing (secret from env), reasonable expiry (env-configurable).\n\nPassword hashing with bcrypt.\n\nRate-limit suggestions (note: you can mention slowapi or reverse-proxy rate limiting).\n\nDev & deployment\n\nInclude requirements.txt with pinned versions (FastAPI, uvicorn, databases/aiomysql or aiomysql, passlib, python-jose, pydantic, mysqlclient if needed).\n\nProvide docker-compose.yml for a local MySQL and the FastAPI service, plus instructions to run.\n\nProvide Makefile or scripts for common tasks: start, migrate, create-superuser.\n\nTests (minimum)\n\nProvide at least a couple of pytest examples showing how to test endpoints (authentication + one CRUD), using httpx.AsyncClient and a test database or fixtures.\n\nDeliverables (explicit)\n\nschema.sql generated from attached DDL.\n\nProject folder with files described below.\n\nREADME with setup, env vars, how to run migrations, how to run tests, and how to use the OpenAPI UI.\n\nSuggested folder layout (exact):\n\nbackend/\n\u251c\u2500 app/\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 main.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 config.py                # pydantic settings\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 db.py                    # connection pool and helpers (raw SQL)\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 auth/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 router.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 service.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas.py\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 jwt.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 routers/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 users.py\n\u2502  \u2502 \u2514\u2500 <other resources>.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 services/                # business logic using raw SQL via db.py\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 schemas/                 # pydantic models for resources\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 utils/                   # helpers (passwords, tokens, logging)\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 tests/\n\u251c\u2500 schema.sql\n\u251c\u2500 migrate.sh\n\u251c\u2500 requirements.txt\n\u251c\u2500 docker-compose.yml\n\u2514\u2500 README.md\n\n\nImportant constraints & implementation notes.\n\nUse the attached DDL Script.txt as the canonical source of truth for table/column names and relationships. If the DDL contains constraints or FK references, ensure the schema.sql orders CREATE TABLE statements to satisfy FK dependencies.\n\nAll SQL in code must be parameterized (no string interpolation for user inputs).\n\nUse async DB access patterns (async endpoints, async db driver).\n\nDo not stub out DB queries \u2014 implement real SQL for CRUD that maps to the DDL columns.\n\nInclude at least one example raw SQL query using joins that would be commonly needed (e.g., get timesheet rows for a user with project name).\n\nMake token verification reusable (dependency) and include example of role-based protection (e.g., admin-only endpoint).\n\nUse clear docstrings and small inline comments explaining key decisions.\n\nKeep code idiomatic and production-aware (timeouts, connection pooling, structured settings).\n\nIf something in DDL Script.txt is ambiguous (e.g., missing a users table or missing column type), make a reasonable assumption and explicitly document the assumption in the README and in the top of schema.sql.\n\nOutput format:\n\nProduce the full project tree and the contents of each file.\n\nAlso produce schema.sql and migrate.sh.\n\nInclude a short README and example curl commands for auth + one resource.\n\nEnd of prompt.",
